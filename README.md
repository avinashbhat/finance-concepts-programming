# Programs on Finance Concepts
These are few programs which I wrote to understand simple finance concepts.

Programs are written in Python 3. To run, simply clone the repo and run it using 
```
$ python3 filename.py
```

These are just some beginner programs, I hope to add more as and when I learn something new.
